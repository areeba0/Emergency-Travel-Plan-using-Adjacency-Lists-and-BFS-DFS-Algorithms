# Emergency-Travel-Plan-using-Adjacency-Lists-and-BFS-DFS-Algorithms
This C++ project implements an Emergency Travel Planning System using graph theory's adjacency lists, employing BFS and DFS for efficient city navigation. It optimizes routes based on user preferences for minimizing travel time or cost, with dynamic memory management for city and route data.
