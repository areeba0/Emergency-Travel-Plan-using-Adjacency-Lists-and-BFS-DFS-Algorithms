#  Emergency Travel Planning System using Adjacency Lists and BFS/DFS Algorithms
The Emergency Travel Plan project simulates a scenario where a traveler needs to navigate through cities using both road and aerial routes. The system optimizes routes based on either speed or cost, providing insights into the minimum days required for travel.

# Algorithm
##### - Graph Representation:
Cities and routes are represented using adjacency lists.
##### - Breadth-First Search (BFS): 
Used to find the shortest path in terms of days, either optimizing for speed (shortest path) or cost (least cost).
##### - Dynamic Memory Management: 
Handles memory allocation and deallocation for nodes and arrays.
##### - User Interaction: 
Offers an interactive menu for users to choose between speed or cost optimization.
